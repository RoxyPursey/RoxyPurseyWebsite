        <h2>CyberPunk Music</h2>

        <div class="cyberpunk"><img src="Assets/logo/cyberpunk.png" alt="" /></div>
        <div>
            <p class='text'> I created this logo for my first website project. As a musician, punk-style theme has been
                very influential in my life.
                Punk is about liking what you like, being yourself, and saying what you think. You don't need anything
                to be punk except for awareness, self respect, respect for others and an open mind.
                It's bold, progressive and totally awesome!

            <p class='text'>This logo was inspired by 'The Periodic Table of Elements'. If you took science as a
                subject, you will be all to familiar with this.
                After a few different designs, I landed on this one. The colour pallete gives the 'neon glow effect' and
                it fits perfectly in any cocktail bar.

                A health coach and nutritionist asked me to create this logo as she is currently building her online
                business and wanted a logo
                that incorporates health, wellbeing and mindfulness. I chose Yellow and Teal for the colour palette. We
                associate yellow with sunshine and it represents light. It creates a feeling of hope, happiness and
                wisdom. Yellow evokes an optimistic sense of well being and natural light. It is airy, radiant and
                atmospheric.
                Teal is commonly used to represent open communication and clarity of thought.The blend of colors
                combines the calmness of blue together with the balance of green, making it a unique shade that is
                revitalizing and rejunevating.
                On closer inspection you can see the mandala faintly in the backround and the roundness and shading is
                like a reset button.

                I created this logo for a 24hr hackathon I did at the bootcamp. Since we've all been locked up at home
                and unable to travel. We decided to create an app that would allow you to travel from your couch. Couch
                Flight was born and with the power of the internet and webcams set up all over the world, you can visit
                these destinations from the comfort of your own home.
                I used the world as the focal point that serves as both a webcam and the globe. The couch is taking off
                and leaving your living room in its smoke.

                Michelle More is an inspirational speaker and life coach. Her logo has both intricate and simple
                details.
                The archway of the doors symbolise moving through difficulties or challenges, entering into new spaces
                and opportunities. Doors and openings provide the transition point to change.
                The outline of the door that appears in orange shows an M. The third eye above the doorways symbolises
                the gateway to higher consciousness and the state of enlightenment.
                The color teal is commonly used to represent open communication and clarity of thought. Orange is
                associated with youth, vitality, friendliness, and being open-minded.

                On 23rd April 2020, The Rolling Stones released "Living in a Ghost Town" online as a single.
                The music video shows footage of empty city streets that was taken from across the world.
                The video is shot with a fish eye lense which gave me the idea to make it round.
                I took a more literal approach to the design, making it look
                like an old western backdrop, under the eary moonlight. Its kinda fun and spooky!<br>

                under a microscope.
