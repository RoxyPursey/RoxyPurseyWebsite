                One of my favourite designs I created was for a New York-based client who loved photographing wildlife.
                He traveled to Africa and captured some of the most beautiful imagery I had ever seen.
                I created a 'Peter Beard' inspired collage called 'Scar'.

                <br>
                I fell inlove with the story about the old rugged lion called 'Scar'. I felt like he deserved to be
                front and centre of the piece.
                Scar's mane was damaged from all the wars he fought against other male lions and I wanted to 'beautify'
                it. I decorated his mane with finger prints in the earthy colours.
                The black and white border surrounding Scar is inspired by the Ndebele tribe who are known for their
                strong geometric designs.
                <br>
                I gathered different textures, animals skins, Images, polaroids, and excerpts of his travel diary and
                layered these, creating a beautifully vibrant, truly African montage.

                The same New-York based client loved his 'Scar' piece so much that he asked me to create a similar piece
                of his trip to Chile.
                Layering his spectacular imagery of Patagonia's, succulents, llamas and the Milky way. The black and
                white border is Aztec inspired
                and coupled with the imagery celebrated this amazing South American Adventure.

                When it comes to gifts for special occasions, it's hard to find something that is both meaningful and
                personal. Sometimes the usual materialistic things don't quite cut it.
                I created this special piece for a client's father who was celebrating 60 magical years on this earth.
                This is a collage that features photographs(old and new), the symbolism of favourite music, books,
                movies, travels, quotes and anything and everything that embodies this individual.
                It's a visual masterpiece of the greatest hits of your life and it will be treasured for years to come.
