    <h1>Client 1</h1>
    <div class="text1">
        <p>
            A client had a beautiful family photoshoot and wanted to display these images on 2 seperate walls
            leading up their staircase.They wanted a simple geometric design using only black, white and pewter frames.
            I measured up the walls and built the design in Sketch-Up. Once they approved the shape of the design,
            I added the assorted frames so they had a visualisation of what the wall gallery display would look
            like before going ahead with the production. Doing visual mock-ups helps manage client expectation,
            gives a realistic perspective and is easy to make revisions before production.

    <h1>Client 2</h1>
    <div class="text1">
        <p>
           This client also had a beautiful photoshoot and wanted a wall gallery display that was
           assymetric with a sense of flow. They wanted a design created that could be used on both walls.
           The client provided a brief and photographs of the space so I could create a colour palette.
           I went to the clients house and took wall measurements and designed the space in Sketch-Up.
