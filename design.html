        <div>
            <p class='text7'> I created this logo for my first website project. As a musician, punk-style theme has been
                very influential in my life.
                Punk is about liking what you like, being yourself, and saying what you think. You don't need anything
                to be punk except for awareness, self respect, respect for others and an open mind.
                It's bold, progressive and totally awesome!

                subject, you will be all to familiar with this.
                After a few different designs, I landed on this one. The colour pallete gives the 'neon glow effect' and
                it fits perfectly in any cocktail bar.

                A health coach and nutritionist asked me to create this logo as she is currently building her online
                business and wanted a logo
                that incorporates health, wellbeing and mindfulness. I chose Yellow and Teal for the colour palette. We
                associate yellow with sunshine and it represents light. It creates a feeling of hope, happiness and
                wisdom. Yellow evokes an optimistic sense of well being and natural light. It is airy, radiant and
                atmospheric.
                Teal is commonly used to represent open communication and clarity of thought.The blend of colors
                combines the calmness of blue together with the balance of green, making it a unique shade that is
                revitalizing and rejunevating.
                On closer inspection you can see the mandala faintly in the backround and the roundness and shading is
                like a reset button.

                and unable to travel. We decided to create an app that would allow you to travel from your couch. Couch
                Flight was born and with the power of the internet and webcams set up all over the world, you can visit
                these destinations from the comfort of your own home.
                I used the world as the focal point that serves as both a webcam and the globe. The couch is taking off
                and leaving your living room in its smoke.

                One of my favourite designs I created was for a New York-based client who loved photographing wildlife.
                He traveled to Africa and captured some of the most beautiful imagery I had ever seen.
                I created a 'Peter Beard' inspired collage called 'Scar'.

                <br>
                I fell inlove with the story about the old rugged lion called 'Scar'. I felt like he deserved to be
                front and centre of the piece.
                Scar's mane was damaged from all the wars he fought against other male lions and I wanted to 'beautify'
                it. I decorated his mane with finger prints in the earthy colours.
                The black and white border surrounding Scar is inspired by the Ndebele tribe who are known for their
                strong geometric designs.
                <br>
                I gathered different textures, animals skins, Images, polaroids, and excerpts of his travel diary and
                layered these, creating a beautifully vibrant, truly African montage.

                I created this special piece for a client's father who was celebrating 60 magical years on this earth.
                This is a collage that features photographs(old and new), the symbolism of favourite music, books,
