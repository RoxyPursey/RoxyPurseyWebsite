            Nutrisense is a health tech company thats offers programs with expert guidance to help you interpret your
            own body's data.
            Their product is a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that monitors your glucose 24/7.
            They needed some Instagram posts for their black friday promotion and also some casual posts for everyday
            use.
            I included some great quotes about health which everyone enjoyed.

            We all love a good 'ol British festival but we know that it sometimes is accompanied by a flood or two.
            Rockfish Wellies will keep your feet dry, are very comfortable and not to mention - Super Stylish.
            They come in array of colours and styles and I wouldnt go to any festival without them.
            This advert was featured on their FB page. Woo hoo!

        <p> Mapping the Magic is a love child of mine. I have traveled extensively and want to create a travel instagram
            where I can share my experiences and beautiful photographs of the places I've been so lucky to visit and live.
            This is still in the making, and hopefully I can add this to my website one day.
